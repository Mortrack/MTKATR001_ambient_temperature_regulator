- **/'Core'**:
  - This folder contains the actual Source and Header Code Files of the Project.
- **/'Debug'**:
  - Although I do not know the full extend of the purpose of this folder auto-generated by the STM32CubeIDE, an important thing to know is that here is where the STM32CubeIDE will store the Firmware Image file of the project after compilation in its .bin extension.
- **/'documentation'**:
  - This folder contains the documentation of this project.

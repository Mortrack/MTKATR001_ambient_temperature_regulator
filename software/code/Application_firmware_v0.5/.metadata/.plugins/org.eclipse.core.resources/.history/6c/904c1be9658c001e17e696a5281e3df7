 * @{
 *
 * @brief   This module provides the functions, definitions, structures and variables required to enable the application
 *          to be able to Configure, Initialize and Send and/or Receive data to/from a HM-10 CTFZ54812 ZS-040 Bluetooth
 *          Clone Device, which you may find in the market also under the tag of AT-09.
 *
 * @note    As for now, this @ref hm10_ble_clone provides you with the necessary things so that you can configure and
 *          use an HM-10 Clone BLE Device in peripheral mode only. Although you can also configure it as Central mode
 *          with this module,
 *          all the available functions, definitions and structures to use that mode have not yet been implemented. The
 *          reason for this is because during the tests conducted with that Device, it was identified that a lot of the
 *          required functionalities to properly use the device in its Central Mode do not work in the Clone
 *          Model and only do work in the Original Model.
 * @note    Among the several functions required and that the Clone Model lacks for the Central Mode to work properly,
 *          we have that you will not be able to disconnect the HM-10 Clone BLE Device after connecting it with another
 *          BLE Device (regardless if your Device is in Peripheral or in Central Mode). However, you could make an
 *          external circuitry to electrically shut-down and then turn on the device to reset it in order to force it to
 *          disconnect. Despite this, whenever using Central Mode, this Clone Device will not provide sufficient
 *          information so that the user, or even the implementer, can guess to what slave BLE Device your Central mode
 *          BLE Device should connect to, especially in the case that it was intended for it to connect with new BLE
 *          devices overtime for a certain type of application. However, it could work out for you if you would, perhaps
 *          make a particular and specific system in which you would want it to always connect to the same slave BLE
 *          Device, but where you already know before-hand the address of that slave BLE Device of interest. Despite all
 *          this, you should keep in mind that you will not be able to connect your Central Mode BLE Device with more
 *          than one slave device. This is not only because of the limitation of not being able to disconnect them from
 *          the Central Mode Device in the case of not disposing of an external circuit as previously mentioned, but
 *          also because the Clone BLE device in Central mode automatically reconnects to the last connected slave BLE
 *          Device. This means, that your only choice there would be to turn off the slave device before electrically
 *          resetting the Clone BLE Device so that the Central Device doesnt automatically reconnect to the slave
 *          device, where you will have to then change the configurations of your Central Device to Default (with the
 *          default AT command that has not yet been implemented in this module) and then reconfigure it again to
 *          connect to another slave BLE Device. Nonetheless, because these complications really limit the use of this
 *          HM-10 Clone BLE Device in Central mode, the author of this @ref hm10_ble_clone suggests using this Clone
 *          Model only in Peripheral Mode, or in Central Mode if your Device will only ever connect to the same Slave
 *          BLE Device.
 * @note    On the other hand, make sure to supply to the HM-10 Clone BLE Device with the right Voltage Power Supply,
 *          which is 3.6v-6v (I used 5v and it worked correctly with it) so that the BLE module of that device's PCB
 *          board works correctly. This is very important, because you could get the wrong idea that this Device can
 *          work with a lower voltage (e.g., I tried with 3.3v) because its UART module can work with even 3.3v, but its
 *          actual BLE module will not work most of the time and you will have a very rough time trying to connect with
 *          the device and to make it work correctly.
 * @note    Another thing to highlight is that this @ref hm10_ble_clone has included the "stm32f1xx_hal.h" header file
 *          to be able to use the UART in this module. However, this header file is specifically meant for the STM32F1
 *          series devices. If yours is from a different type, then you will have to substitute the right one here for
 *          your particular STMicroelectronics device. However, if you cant figure out what the name of that header file
 *          is, then simply substitute that line of code from this @ref hm10_ble_clone by: #include "main.h"
 *
 * @details While it is not necessary to use all the entirety of the functions provided to use the HM-10 Clone BLE
 *          Device in peripheral mode, the following code example demonstrate how to use them in case that its
 *          implementer requires an application reference:

/**@file
 *
 * @defgroup app_etx_ota_config Application ETX OTA Protocol Configuration File
 * @{
 *
 * @brief   This file should contain all the Application ETX OTA Protocol Configurations made by the user/implementor.
 *
 * @note    It is highly suggested not to directly edit the Configurations Settings defined in this file. Instead of
 *          doing that whenever requiring different Configuration Settings, it is suggested to do that instead in an
 *          additional header file named as "app_etx_ota_config.h" whose File Path should be located as a sibbling of
 *          this @ref etx_ota_config header file. However, to enable the use of that additional header file, you will
 *          also need to change the @ref ENABLE_APP_ETX_OTA_CONFIG define, that is located at @ref etx_ota_config, to a
 *          value of 1.

 * @defgroup firmware_update Firmware Update module
 * @{
 *
 * @brief	This module provides the functions required to enable the application to be able to handle Firmware Update
 *          requests via ETX OTA Protocol and to install Application Firmware Images in our MCU/MPU if requested by
 *          using our MCU/MPU's UART2 as a communication channel.
 *
 * @details	The ETX OTA process sends/receives data through Packets.
 * @details There 4 types of Packets:
 *          <ol>
 *              <li>Command Type Packets</li>
 *              <li>Header Type Packets</li>
 *              <li>Data Type Packets</li>
 *              <li>Response Type Packets</li>
 *          </ol>
 *          where it is suggested to see @ref ETX_OTA_Packet_t for more details.
 * @details The General Data Format for all types of Packets is the following set of bytes:
 *          <ol>
 *              <li>Start of Frame (SOF): 1 byte</li>
 *              <li>Packet Type: 1 byte</li>
 *              <li>Data Length: 2 bytes</li>
 *              <li>Data: 1 up to 1024 bytes</li>
 *              <li>CRC32: 4 bytes</li>
 *              <li>End of Frame (EOF): 1 byte</li>
 *          </ol>
 *          but for finer details on the Data Format for each type of ETX OTA Packet, see @ref ETX_OTA_Command_Packet_t ,
 *          @ref ETX_OTA_Header_Packet_t , @ref ETX_OTA_Data_Packet_t and @ref ETX_OTA_Response_Packet_t .
 * @details On the other hand, the ETX OTA Protocol has 5 different states that indicate the part of the process at which
 *          we are located at with respect to a single Firmware Update process, which are given by the following in that
 *          order:
 *          <ol>
 *              <li>ETX OTA Idle State</li>
 *              <li>ETX OTA Start State</li>
 *              <li>ETX OTA Header State</li>
 *              <li>ETX OTA Data State</li>
 *              <li>ETX OTA End State</li>
 *          </ol>
 *          where it is suggested to see @ref ETX_OTA_State for more details.
 * @details Finally, the way our MCU/MPU will interact with a host is that the host will send a single packet for each
 * 			ETX OTA State, except maybe in the Data State since multiple packets are allowed there. Nonetheless, our
 * 			MCU/MPU will expect the ETX OTA States to transition in the order previously shown and our MCU/MPU will
 * 			also both validate the received data and, if it is successful on that, it will always respond back to the
 * 			host with an ETX OTA Response Type Packet to let it know whether or not our MCU/MPU was able to successfully
 * 			get and process the data of the each Packet by sending an ACK, or otherwise with a NACK.

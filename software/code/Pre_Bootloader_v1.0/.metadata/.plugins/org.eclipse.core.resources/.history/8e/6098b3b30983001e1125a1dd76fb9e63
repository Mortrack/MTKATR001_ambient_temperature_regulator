 * @{
 *
 * @brief       This sub-module provides the functions required to enable the @ref firmware_update to be able to store
 *              and retrieve the Firmware Update Configurations in or from our MCU/MPU's Flash Memory respectively.
 *
 * @details 	The strategy followed by this sub-module is to use our MCU/MPU's Flash Memory with a modified method of
 * 				<a href=http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/appnotes/01095c.pdf>MICROCHIP's Emulating Data EEPROM</a>,
 *              where the next data to be written will be made linearly in the currently designated Flash Memory
 *              addresses and in a very simple and straightforward way. The way the data will be written is that each
 *              time there is a new data to write into the Flash Memory designated pages, this data will be written
 *              right after the most recently written data. Whenever we write into the last available address of the
 *              designated Flash Memory pages, the program will continue writing on the initial address. For this to
 *              work out, whenever one Firmware Update Configurations Page is full of data (which differs from a Flash
 *              Memory and where 1 Firmware Update Configurations Page is actually compoased of 2 Flash Memory pages),
 *              then the program will jump from one Firmware Update Configurations page to another and the previous page
 *              that was left full of written data will be erased. However, this will only happen after one of the two
 *              Firmware Update Configurations Pages is full of data and if this sub-module has already written data
 *              into the other one. As a result, this sub-module will allow the programmer to store and persist Firmware
 *              Update Configuration settings into our MCU/MPU's Flash Memory but by also contributing to preserving the
 *              lifetime of the Flash Memory.
 *
 * @note		The code from this sub-module contemplates/expects the programmer to have fully erased the Flash Memory
 * 				of the MCU/MPU only for the very first time that this library is used in that device. If this is true,
 * 				then it is safe to use this library. However, if this is not the case, then the code from this
 * 				sub-module might have undefined behaviors unless the programmer guarantees that the Flash Memory pages
 * 				dedicated to this sub-module have been fully erased for the very first time that this
 * 				library's/sub-module's code is used in that MCU/MPU.
 *
 * @note		While this code was inspired from a code that I, Cesar Miranda Meza, worked when I was employed at
 *              Acuity Brands during 2023, it is simply that: inspired from. This is because this code has been made
 *              very differently with several original concepts and ideas that Cesar Miranda Meza came out with after
 *              having worked at that company and that is also used for a very different purpose/application than the
 *              one used at Acuity Brands for their version "of this code".
 *
 * @details		The following is a code example for initializing this sub-module and also for showing how to read and
 * 				write data in it.
 * @code
 #include "firmware_update_config.h" // We call the library that holds the Firmware Update Configurations sub-module.

 int main()
 {
	FirmUpdConf_Status ret; // Local variable used to hold the exception code values returned by functions of the Firmware Update Configurations sub-module.
	firmware_update_config_data_t p_data; //Local struct used to either pass to it the data that we want to write into the designated Flash Memory pages of the @ref firmware_update_config sub-module or, in the case of a read request, where that sub-module will write the latest data contained in the sub-module.

	// We initialize the Firmware Update Configurations sub-module. This should only be called once in the lifetime of the program.
	ret = firmware_update_configurations_init();
	if (ret != FIRM_UPDT_CONF_EC_OK)
	{
		printf("ERROR CODE %d: The Firmware Update Configurations sub-module could not be initialized...\r\n", ret);
		return ret;
	}

	// We read the latest data that has been written into the Flash Memory designated to the Firmware Update Configurations sub-module. This can be done as many times as desired during the lifetime of the program.
	ret = firmware_update_configurations_read(&p_data);
	if (ret == FIRM_UPDT_CONF_EC_NO_DATA)
	{
		printf('There is currently no data written into the Firmware Update Configurations sub-module.\r\n');
	}
	else
	{
		printf("The data that was read from the Firmware Update Configurations sub-module is the following:\r\n");
		printf("Bootloader Firmware size = %d\r\n", p_data.BL_fw_size);
		printf("Bootloader Firmware recorded 32-bit CRC = %d\r\n", p_data.BL_fw_rec_crc);
		printf("Application Firmware size = %d\r\n", p_data.App_fw_size);
		printf("Application Firmware recorded 32-bit CRC = %d\r\n", p_data.App_fw_rec_crc);
	}

	// We write a new data block to the Flash Memory designated to the Firmware Update Configurations sub-module. This can be done as many times as desired during the lifetime of the program.
	// NOTE: If you only want to write a few couple of fields of the "firmware_update_config_data_t structure, then make sure to first read the latest data written into the Firmware Update Configurations sub-module before writing something into it so that you don't overwrite the other data with something else.
	p_data.App_fw_size = 10240; // This is a fake value, for demonstration purposes only.
	p_data.App_fw_rec_crc = 0x45AB68B3; // This is a fake value, for demonstration purposes only.
	ret = firmware_update_configurations_write(&p_data);
	if (ret != FIRM_UPDT_CONF_EC_OK)
	{
		printf("ERROR CODE %d: The data was not written into the Firmware Update Configurations sub-module.\r\n");
		return ret;
	}

	printf("The data was successfully written into the Firmware Update Configurations sub-module.\r\n");
    return 0;

 *	@brief	ETX OTA Protocol source file for Pre-Bootloader Firmwares.
 *
 * @defgroup pre_bl_side_etx_ota Firmware Update module
 * @{
 *
 * @brief	This module provides the functions required to enable the application to be able to install a Firmware Image
 *          located at the Flash Memory location address of the Application Firmware (i.e., @ref ETX_APP_FLASH_ADDR )
 *          into the Flash Memory location address of the Bootloader Firmware (i.e., @ref ETX_BL_FLASH_ADDR ).
 *
 * @note    This module expects the Firmware Image to have been previously stored with the ETX OTA Protocol made by
 *          Mortrack.
 *
 * @details The way in which this Firmware Image installation process is made is via the ETX OTA Protocol, which is a
 *          protocol that serves for the purpose of transferring data from a certain host device to a slave device
 *          (i.e., our MCU/MPU) and, in particular, for data whose integrity is considered to be critically important
 *          since this protocol prioritizes data transfer reliability over data transfer speed.
 *
 * @note    Another thing to highlight is that this @ref pre_bl_side_etx_ota has included the "stm32f1xx_hal.h" header
 *          file in its .c file counter part (i.e., firmware_update_config.c ) to be able to use the UART in this
 *          module. However, this header file is specifically meant for the STM32F1 series devices. If yours is from a
 *          different type, then you will have to substitute the right one here for your particular STMicroelectronics
 *          device. However, if you cant figure out what the name of that header file is, then simply substitute that
 *          line of code from this firmware_update_config.c File by: #include "main.h"
 * @note    <b style="color:orange">IMPORTANT:</b> This @ref pre_bl_side_etx_ota , has included the "stm32f1xx_hal.h"
 *          header file (via the Source file of this module) to be able to use HAL functions in this module. However,
 *          this header file is specifically meant for the STM32F1 series devices. If yours is from a different type,
 *          then you will have to substitute the right one here for your particular STMicroelectronics device. However,
 *          if you cant figure out what the name of that header file is, then simply substitute that line of code from
 *          this @ref hm10_ble by: #include "main.h"
 * @note    <b style="color:red">WARNING:</b> This Library should be able to perfectly compile with no GCC Optimization
 *          Level (i.e., GCC "O0" Optimization Level). However, If you were to compile a certain project that uses this
 *          Library with a certain GCC Optimization Level, then it is very likely that this Library will not work. The
 *          reason for this does not lie in this actual Library, but in the HAL Library of the STMicroelectronics Team.
 *          In particular, this gives place in the @ref HAL_FLASH_Unlock function, which requires to be executed
 *          exactly as how the STMicroelectronics Team coded it, which does not happen whenever you Optimize that code.
 *          Therefore, one solution for this problem is to tell the GCC Compiler not to optimize the code of the
 *          @ref HAL_FLASH_Unlock function.  One way to do this is by using the Pragma Tags as in the following
 *          example:<br>
 * @code
 #pragma GCC push_options
 #pragma GCC optimize ("O0")
 HAL_StatusTypeDef HAL_FLASH_Unlock(void)
 {
     // Code of the HAL_FLASH_Unlock() Function here (I did not pasted its code here for simplicity reasons).
 }
 #pragma GCC pop_options
 * @endcode
 *          where these Pragma tags will tell the GCC compiler not to Optimize all the code inside
 *          "#pragma GCC push_options" and "#pragma GCC pop_options" Tags.<br>
 *          However, this will only work if your GCC is v4.4 or higher. Therefore, if your GCC has a lower version, then
 *          use the following method to tell the GCC Compiler not to optimize that code:
 * @code
 HAL_StatusTypeDef __attribute__((optimize("O0"))) HAL_FLASH_Unlock(void)
 {
     // Code of the HAL_FLASH_Unlock() Function here (I did not pasted its code here for simplicity reasons).
 }
 * @endcode
 *          <b style="color:orange">Whenever any of these solutions is implemented, it is very important to</b> make
 *          sure to rewrite the HAL Library of the STMicroelectronics Team with the chosen solution after each time you
 *          re-configure your project via the STM32CubeMx App since it is likely for this App to rewrite the HAL Library
 *          as it originally was released by the STMicroelectronics Team, which as previously stated, it does not
 *          include any of the proposed solutions.

 *          (i.e., @ref ETX_BL_FLASH_ADDR ).
 *
 * @details This function will first check if the size in bytes of the Firmware Image located at the Flash Memory
 *          location address of the Application firmware (i.e., @ref ETX_APP_FLASH_ADDR ) is perfectly divisible by 4
 *          bytes. Only in the case that this is true, will then this function install that Firmware Image. Otherwise,
 *          this function will terminate.
 * @details Also, in the case that the Firmware Image is successfully installed, then this function will update the
 *          Configuration Settings from the @ref firmware_update_config correspondingly and will persist them into its
 *          designated Flash Memory (@ref firmware_update_config_data_t::BL_fw_size ,

 *
 * @note    This function expects the implementer to have correctly previously validated that the Firmware Image located
 *          at the Flash Memory location address of the Application Firmware (i.e., @ref ETX_APP_FLASH_ADDR )
 *          corresponds to a Bootloader Firmware Image. If that image ends up not being a Bootloader Firmware Image
 *          type, then our MCU/MPU's program/software will most probably not work.

 * @retval  ETX_OTA_EC_OK   if the Firmware Image located at the Flash Memory location address of the Application
 *                          Firmware (i.e., @ref ETX_APP_FLASH_ADDR ) is correctly installed into the Flash Memory
 *                          location address of the Bootlaoder Firmware (i.e., @ref ETX_BL_FLASH_ADDR ).
 * @retval	ETX_OTA_EC_NR   if there was no response from the HAL of our MCU/MPU whenever either attempting to
 *                          unlock/lock the HAL FLASH or; to erase/write in the Flash Memory designated to the

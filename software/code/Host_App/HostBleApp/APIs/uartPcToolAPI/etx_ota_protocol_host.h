 * @{
 *
 * @brief	This module provides the functions required to enable the application to be able to send and handle Payload
 *          requests via ETX OTA Protocol, which also includes sending and requesting installation of Firmware Images,
 *          to our external device with which the Serial Port communication of this module has been established with.
 *
 * @details	The ETX OTA Protocol sends/receives data through Packets.
 * @details There 4 types of Packets:
 *          <ol>
 *              <li>Command Type Packets</li>
 *              <li>Header Type Packets</li>
 *              <li>Data Type Packets</li>
 *              <li>Response Type Packets</li>
 *          </ol>
 *          where it is suggested to see @ref ETX_OTA_Packet_t for more details.
 * @details The General Data Format for all types of Packets is the following set of bytes:
 *          <ol>
 *              <li>Start of Frame (SOF): 1 byte</li>
 *              <li>Packet Type: 1 byte</li>
 *              <li>Data Length: 2 bytes</li>
 *              <li>Data: 1 up to 1024 bytes (size must be perfectly divisible by 4 bytes)</li>
 *              <li>CRC32: 4 bytes</li>
 *              <li>End of Frame (EOF): 1 byte</li>
 *          </ol>
 *          but for finer details on the Data Format for each type of ETX OTA Packet, see @ref ETX_OTA_Command_Packet_t ,
 *          @ref ETX_OTA_Header_Packet_t , @ref ETX_OTA_Data_Packet_t and @ref ETX_OTA_Response_Packet_t .
 * @details On the other hand, a whole ETX OTA Transaction has 5 different states, where each of them can indicate in
 *          what part of the whole transaction we current are at, which are given by the following in that order:
 *          <ol>
 *              <li>ETX OTA Idle State</li>
 *              <li>ETX OTA Start State</li>
 *              <li>ETX OTA Header State</li>
 *              <li>ETX OTA Data State</li>
 *              <li>ETX OTA End State</li>
 *          </ol>
 *          where it is suggested to see @ref ETX_OTA_State for more details.
 * @details Finally, the way our external device will interact with our host machine is that the host will send a single
 *          packet for each ETX OTA State, except maybe in the ETX OTA Data State since multiple packets are allowed
 *          there. Nonetheless, our external device will expect the ETX OTA States to transition in the order previously
 *          shown and our external device will also both validate the received data and, if it is successful on that, it
 *          will always respond back to the host with an ETX OTA Response Type Packet to let it know whether or not our
 *          external device was able to successfully get and process the data of each Packet by sending an ACK, or
 *          otherwise with a NACK.
 *
 * @note    To learn more details about how to setup this library and how to compile this program, see the Readme.md
 *          File of the project that is using this library.

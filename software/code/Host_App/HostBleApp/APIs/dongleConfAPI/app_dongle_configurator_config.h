 * @defgroup app_dongle_configurator_config Application Dongle Configurator Configuration File
 * @{
 *
 * @brief   This file should contain all the Dongle Configurator Configurations that are wished to be changed from their
 *          default values, which are defined as such in the @ref dongle_configurator file.
 *
 * @note    It is highly suggested not to directly edit the Configurations Settings defined in the
 *          @ref dongle_configurator_config file. Instead of doing that whenever requiring different Configuration
 *          Settings, it is suggested to do that instead in this additional header file named as
 *          "app_dongle_configurator_config.h". However, to enable the use of this additional header file, you will also
 *          need to change the @ref ENABLE_APP_DONGLE_CONFIGURATOR_CONFIG define, that is located at
 *          @ref dongle_configurator_config, to a value of 1.
 * @note    For more details on how to use this @ref app_dongle_configurator_config , see the Readme.md file of the
 *          project on which the Dongle Configurator library is being used at.

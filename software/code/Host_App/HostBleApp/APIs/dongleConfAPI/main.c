/**@brief   Main function of the main application program whose purpose is to act as an API that is to receive some
 *          RS-232 Serial Port Configurations from the user via Command Line Arguments in order to then configure the
 *          requested HM-10 BT Device (also via the Command Line Arguments) in Central Mode.
 *
 * @param argc      Contains the total number of Command Line Arguments that are given whenever executing the program
 *                  contained in this file. The total number of arguments consider here will also include the command
 *                  executed on the terminal window to run the program contained in this file. For example, if the
 *                  Terminal Window Command used on the terminal window, in a Windows O.S., was
 *                  \code .\APIs\dongleConfAPI\ETX_OTA_Protocol_BLE_API 4 9600 8 N 1 0 1000 500000 \endcode
 *                  then
 *                  \code argc = 9 \endcode
 * @param[in] argv  Holds the actual Command Line Arguments that are given whenever executing the program contained in
 *                  this file. Each argument will be allocated in a different index within the \p argv param, but were
 *                  the first index will contain the command executed on the terminal window to run the program
 *                  contained in this file and then the actual Command Line Arguments will be placed subsequently. For
 *                  example, if the Terminal Window Command used on the terminal window was
 *                  \code .\APIs\dongleConfAPI\ETX_OTA_Protocol_BLE_API 4 9600 8 N 1 0 1000 500000 \endcode
 *                  then
 *                  \code argv[9] = {".\APIs\dongleConfAPI\ETX_OTA_Protocol_BLE_API" "4" "9600" "8" "N" "1" "0" "1000" "500000"} \endcode
 *
 * @note    This @ref main function expects to be given the following Command Line Arguments via the \p argv param:<br>
 *          <ul>
 *              <li>Command Line Argument index 0 = @ref TERMINAL_WINDOW_EXECUTION_COMMAND </li>
 *              <li>Command Line Argument index 1 = @ref COMPORT_NUMBER </li>
 *              <li>Command Line Argument index 2 = @ref RS232_BAUDRATE </li>
 *              <li>Command Line Argument index 3 = @ref RS232_MODE_DATA_BITS </li>
 *              <li>Command Line Argument index 4 = @ref RS232_MODE_PARITY </li>
 *              <li>Command Line Argument index 5 = @ref RS232_MODE_STOPBITS </li>
 *              <li>Command Line Argument index 6 = @ref RS232_IS_FLOW_CONTROL </li>
 *              <li>Command Line Argument index 7 = @ref SEND_PACKET_BYTES_DELAY </li>
 *              <li>Command Line Argument index 8 = @ref TEUNIZ_LIB_POLL_COMPORT_DELAY </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          where each of the values, given in String Type, are expected to be humanly read as the actual values that
 *          they should have. For example, if Command Line Argument index 1 String Type value = "1", then it will mean
 *          that the other end of the API requested the @ref main_program to set the Comport Number 1. Another example
 *          would be: if Command Line Argument index 7 String Type value = "1024", then it will mean that the other end
 *          of the API requested the @ref main_program to set a delay of 1024 microseconds each time after a byte of
 *          data is send to the HM-10 BT Device.

 *
 * @note    For more details on the returned values, see @ref DONGLE_CONFIGURATOR_Status .
 *
 * @note    This function also sends the returned value (i.e., retval) to the other program that called the API of the
 *          @ref main_program via the Stream (i.e., via the @ref printf function), since that is the means of
 *          communication between the @ref main_program and the other program previously mentioned.

 * @{
 *
 * @brief	This module provides the functions required to enable the application to be able to install a Firmware Image
 *          located at the Flash Memory location address of the Application Firmware (i.e., @ref ETX_APP_FLASH_ADDR )
 *          into the Flash Memory location address of the Bootloader Firmware (i.e., @ref ETX_BL_FLASH_ADDR ).
 *
 * @note    This module expects the Firmware Image to have been previously stored with the ETX OTA Protocol made by
 *          Mortrack.
 * @note    Another thing to highlight is that this @ref hm10_ble_clone has included the "stm32f1xx_hal.h" header file
 *          to be able to use the UART in this module. However, this header file is specifically meant for the STM32F1
 *          series devices. If yours is from a different type, then you will have to substitute the right one here for
 *          your particular STMicroelectronics device. However, if you cant figure out what the name of that header file
 *          is, then simply substitute that line of code from this @ref hm10_ble_clone by: #include "main.h"

/**@brief   Attempts to install a Firmware Image located at the Flash Memory location address of the Application
 *          Firmware (i.e., @ref ETX_APP_FLASH_ADDR ) into the Flash Memory location address of the Bootloader Firmware
 *          (i.e., @ref ETX_BL_FLASH_ADDR ).
 *
 * @details This function will first check if the size in bytes of the Firmware Image located at the Flash Memory
 *          location address of the Application firmware (i.e., @ref ETX_APP_FLASH_ADDR ) is perfectly divisible by 4
 *          bytes. Only in the case that this is true, will then this function install that Firmware Image. Otherwise,
 *          this function will terminate.
 * @details Also, in the case that the Firmware Image is successfully installed, then this function will update the
 *          Configuration Settings from the @ref firmware_update_config correspondingly and will persist them into its
 *          designated Flash Memory (@ref firmware_update_config_data_t::BL_fw_size ,
 *          @ref firmware_update_config_data_t::BL_fw_rec_crc and
 *          @ref firmware_update_config_data_t::is_bl_fw_install_pending will be updated only).
 *
 * @note    This function expects the implementer to have correctly previously validated that the Firmware Image located
 *          at the Flash Memory location address of the Application Firmware (i.e., @ref ETX_APP_FLASH_ADDR )
 *          corresponds to a Bootloader Firmware Image. If that image ends up not being a Bootloader Firmware Image
 *          type, then our MCU/MPU's program/software will most probably not work.
 *
 * @param[in] p_fw_config   Pointer to the struct that should already contain the latest data of the
 *                          @ref firmware_update_config .
 *
 * @retval  ETX_OTA_EC_OK   if the Firmware Image located at the Flash Memory location address of the Application
 *                          Firmware (i.e., @ref ETX_APP_FLASH_ADDR ) is correctly installed into the Flash Memory
 *                          location address of the Bootlaoder Firmware (i.e., @ref ETX_BL_FLASH_ADDR ).
 * @retval	ETX_OTA_EC_NR   if there was no response from the HAL of our MCU/MPU whenever either attempting to
 *                          unlock/lock the HAL FLASH or; to erase/write in the Flash Memory designated to the
 *                          Bootloader Firmware Image of our MCU/MPU.
 * @retval	ETX_OTA_EC_ERR  otherwise.

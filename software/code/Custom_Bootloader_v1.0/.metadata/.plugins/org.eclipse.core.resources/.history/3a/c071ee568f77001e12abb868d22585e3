 *              <li><b>ETX OTA Start State:</b> Validate the latest ETX OTA Packet to be that of an ETX OTA Command Type
 *                                              Packet containing the Start Command in it and, if successful, then
 *                                              change current ETX OTA State to ETX OTA Header State.</li>
 *              <li><b>ETX OTA Header State:</b> Validate the latest ETX OTA Packet to be that of an ETX OTA Header
 *                                               Type Packet and, if successful, then validate the incoming Firmware
 *                                               Image to be that of an Application Firmware Image. If successful, then
 *                                               write that data into the @ref firmware_update_config sub-module. If
 *                                               everything goes well up to this point, then change the current ETX OTA
 *                                               State to ETX OTA Data State.</li>

 *                                             our MCU/MPU's Application Firmware. Repeat this explained process for all
 *                                             the ETX OTA Data Type Packets to be received by our MCU/MPU. After the
 *                                             last ETX OTA Data Packet has been successfully, change the current ETX
 *                                             OTA State to ETX OTA End State.</li>

 *                                            Packet containing the End Command in it and, if successful, then validate
 *                                            the CRC of the Application Firmware Image that has just been installed. If
 *                                            this is successful, then change the current ETX OTA State to ETX OTA Idle
